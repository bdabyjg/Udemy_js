### 65 Passing Functions as Argument
....Functions are also objects. That being said, it makes sense that with functions we can do the same things that we can do with objects. So let's see some facts of functions.<br>
first as we already know, a function is an instance of the object type, and because of that, a function behaves like any other object. We can store functions in a variable and we already know that. And we can pass a function as an argument to another function. We can also return a function from a function. Because of all that, we say that in Javascript we have first class functions. <br>
... We set up some event listeners back then. We passed a function into each one of them.  <br>
This function is used to receive an array and return a new array, and do the calculations based on a function that we pass into the calculation function.<br>
... 
We're gonna passed in here is the array,which will be the years array and then we will pass a function which does the actual calculations. <br>
In here, we will simply loop over the array, and return a result. The first thing is to create a new, empty array which will be the one that we're gonna fill and then return. So var arr for the result, so I'm just going to say arrRes here, and it's an empty array. We set up a new variable i, which is our counter, set it to 0 and then loop as long as "i" is smaller than the length of the array that we input. Then after each loop, we increment our counter by 1. Ok, down here, inside of the loop, we will then use the function that we can pass into the function. We will push something into our result array here. We use the push function, or push method, which inserts an element at the end of an array. So the big question here is "What are we actually going to push into the array?" The answer is that it will be the result of calling a "fn" function. So "fn" and then we pass the current element of our input array into this function, array i. This will make a lot more sense after you see one of the functions that we're going to program next. Now all we have to do is to actually return this result array. So return "arrRes".
