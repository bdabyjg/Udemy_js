# Promise and Fetch API

**Promise:**

* An object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation.
* A container for an asynchronously delivered value.
* A container for a future value.(Response from AJAX call)
* We no longer need to rely on events and callbacks passed into asynchronous functions to handle asynchronous results;
* Instead of nesting callbacks, we can chain promises for a sequence of asynchronous operations: escaping callback hell.
