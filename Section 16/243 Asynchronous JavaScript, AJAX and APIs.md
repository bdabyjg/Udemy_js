# 243 Asynchronous JavaScript, AJAX and APIs



#### Synchronous:

* Most code is synchronous;
* Synchronous code is executed line by line;
* Each line of code waits for previous line to finish;
* Long-running operations block code execution.



#### Asynchronous:

* Asynchronous code is executed after a tsk that runs in the "background" finishes;
* Asynchronous code is non-blocking;
* Execution doesn't wait for an asynchronous task to finish its work;
* Callback functions alone do NOT make code asynchronous.

Asynchronous means not occurring at the same time.



#### AJAX

#### API

Application Programming Interface: Piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow applications to talk to each other;
