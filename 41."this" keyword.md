## "this" keyword
So the "this" variable is a variable that each and every execution context gets. And as we already know, it is stored in the execution context object. So where does "this" variable, or the "this" keyword point? In a regular function call, the "this" keyword is simply points at the global object, which in case of the browser is the window object. And this is actually the default, simple as that. In a method call which is a function that is attached to an object, the "this" variable points to the object that is calling the method. And something is important about this is that "this" keyword is not assigned a value until the function where it is defined is actually called. So again, even though it appears that the "this" variable refers to the object where it is defined, the "this" variable is technically only assigned a value as soon as an object calls a method. "This" keyword is attached to an execution context which is created as soon as the function is invoked, which also means called. So "invoked" and "called" are the same thing.
