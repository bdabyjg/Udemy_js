## Make decision If/else Statement

... So we have a Boolean value now and we can use this to take decisions using an 'if statement'. The 'If statement' works like this. All we have to do is write 'if' then open parenthesis and then in here goes a condition that is evaluated.  And if this condition turns out to be true, then this block will be executed.  So basically whatever code that we write into this block which is denoted by these curly braces will be executed whenever the condition that's here is true. So in this case, let's put the condition and with condition basically mean something  that is a Boolean value. </br>

.. So again, whenever this value here is true then the code that's in this block here will be executed. And if it's false, well, then it's not going to be executed.
