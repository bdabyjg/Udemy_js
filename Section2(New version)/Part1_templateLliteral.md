## Part 1 Template literals

So with template literals, we can write a string in a more normal way, then basically insert the variables directly into the string.  And then they will simply be replaced. So basically a template literal can assemble multiple pieces into one final string.<br/>...And now to write a template literal, we need to use "backticks". On the English keyboard, you will find this above the tab key. So again, we really need to use these "backticks" to tell JavaScript that we're writing a template string. The single quotes or the double quotes won't work for what we're going to do now. Now we simply write a string and insert the variables in there. Then we use the dollar sign, curly braces, and then the variable name... Here we used this syntax(the dollar sign and the curly braces) to insert the "first name" variable. Now we can continue this and it's gonna to be a lot easier. We can basically write any JavaScript here inside of these curly braces. Technically we can write any expressions but more about expressions in one of the later lectures.<br>

We can actually use the backticks to write all strings. So strings, where we do not, insert any of these kind of placeholders. So we just demonstrated to you. We can use backticks for any irregular string. So whenever you need a multiline string, you always make sure to use this template literal because it's a lot cleaner.
