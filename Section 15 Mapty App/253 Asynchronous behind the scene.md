# 253 Asynchronous behind the scene

Quickly review the JavaScript runtime :

A JavaScript runtime is basically a container which includes all the different pieces that are necessary to execute JavaScript code. The heart of every JavaScript runtime is the engine. A code is executed where objects are stored in memory. These tow things happen in the call stack and in the heap. What's important to note here is that JavaScript has only one threat of execution. It can only do one thing at a time. There is absolutely no multitasking happening in JavaScript itself. Other languages like Java can execute multiple pieces of code at the same time, but not JavaScript. Web API -- some APIs provided to the engine, but which are actually not part of  the JavaScript language itself. Data queue holds all the ready to be executed callback functions  that are attached to some event that has occurred. Finally whatever the call stack is empty the event loop takes callback from the callback queue and puts them into call stack so that they can be executed. The event loop is the essential  piece that makes asynchronous behavior possible in JavaScript. It's the reason why we can have a non blocking concurrency model in JavaScript. A concurrency model is simply how a language handles multiple things happening at the same time.
