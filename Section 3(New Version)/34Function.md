# Function

So we called the fruit processor function here,with two arguments, five and zero. And these arguments are the specific. So the actual values of the functions parameters which are apples and oranges and so when the function is running now, apples in here will be five and oranges will be zero. Then we use these values to build this juice string here and then we return that value from the function and what that means is that basically the result of calling this function here will be the juice value that was just returned. And then we need to save that value somewhere we need to capture it and we do that by basically saving it into this apple juice variable. Then we can simply lock that value to the console. Of course we could have also directly logged it to the console. So basically without capturing the value anywhere and simply log in it.<br/>

..The only difference is that in this case here we did not capture the value into any variable.  We simply log the result of running this function to the console directly （第一个是把这个返回结果赋值给一个变量，然后打印这个变量；第二个则是直接打印这个结果）.Thanks to the power of the function we can reuse the function with different input values and then get a different output.
