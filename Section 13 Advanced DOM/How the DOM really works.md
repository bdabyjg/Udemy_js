# How the DOM really works

Let's start this section by learning how the DOM really works behind the scenes and more specifically how the DOM is organized internally.

So first, remember that the DOM is basically the interface between all JavaScript code and the browser, or more specifically HTML documents that are rendered in and by the browser. Now we're back to working with webpages and therefore with the DOM. This time we're going to learn as much as possible about the DOM and how to create amazing dynamic effects which is that we can use it to make JavaScript interact with the browser and again more specifically we can create and modify and delete elements, set styles and classes and attributes and listen and respond to events. In practice this works because a DOM tree in generated from any HTML document and a DOM tree is a tree like structure made out of nodes which looks something like this. We can then interact with this tree as we already did a couple of times in this course. How does that interaction actually work? Well the DOM is a very complex API which remember stands for application programming interface. So it's the interface we can use to programmatically interact with the DOM. In practice that means that the DOM contains a ton of methods and properties that we use to interact with the DOM tree such as the querySelector, addEventListener or createElement methods, or also the innerHTML, textContent or children properites and many many more.
